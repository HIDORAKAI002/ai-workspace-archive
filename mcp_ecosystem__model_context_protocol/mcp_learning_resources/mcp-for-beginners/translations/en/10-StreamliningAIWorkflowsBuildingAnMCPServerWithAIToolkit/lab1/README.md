## 🧪 Hands-on Exercise 1: Exploring GitHub Models

**🎯 Objective**: Master the Model Catalog and test your first AI model

### 📊 Step 1: Navigate the Model Catalog

The Model Catalog is your gateway to the AI ecosystem. It aggregates models from multiple providers, making it easy to discover and compare options.

**🔍 Navigation Guide:**

Click on **MODELS - Catalog** in the Microsoft Foundry Toolkit sidebar

![Model Catalog](../../../../translated_images/en/aimodel.263ed2be013d8fb0.webp)

**💡 Pro Tip**: Look for models with specific capabilities that match your use case (e.g., code generation, creative writing, analysis).

**⚠️ Note**: GitHub-hosted models (i.e. GitHub Models) are free to use but are subject to rate limits on requests and tokens. If you want to access non-GitHub models (that is, external models hosted via Azure AI or other endpoints), you'll need to supply the appropriate API key or authentication.

### 🚀 Step 2: Add and Configure Your First Model

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- **GPT-4.1**: Best for complex reasoning and analysis
- **Phi-4-mini**: Lightweight, fast responses for simple tasks

**🔧 Configuration Process:**
1. Select **OpenAI GPT-4.1** from the catalog
2. Click **Add to My Models** - this registers the model for use
3. Choose **Try in Playground** to launch the testing environment
4. Wait for model initialization (first-time setup may take a moment)

![Playground Setup](../../../../translated_images/en/playground.dd6f5141344878ca.webp)

**⚙️ Understanding Model Parameters:**
- **Temperature**: Controls creativity (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length
- **Top-p**: Nucleus sampling for response diversity

### 🎯 Step 3: Master the Playground Interface

The Playground is your AI experimentation lab. Here's how to maximize its potential:

**🎨 Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**
1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed instructions yield better results
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Use Examples**: Show the model what you want with examples
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial results

**🧪 Testing Scenarios:**
```markdown
# Example 1: Code Generation
"Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. Include error handling and docstrings."

# Example 2: Creative Writing
"Write a professional email to a client explaining a project delay, maintaining a positive tone while being transparent about challenges."

# Example 3: Data Analysis
"Analyze this sales data and provide insights: [paste your data]. Focus on trends, anomalies, and actionable recommendations."
```

### 🏆 Challenge Exercise: Model Performance Comparison

**🎯 Goal**: Compare different models using identical prompts to understand their strengths

**📋 Instructions:**
1. Add **Phi-4-mini** to your workspace
2. Use the same prompt for both GPT-4.1 and Phi-4-mini

![set](../../../../translated_images/en/set.88132df189ecde2c.webp)

3. Compare response quality, speed, and accuracy
4. Document your findings in the results section

![Model Comparison](../../../../translated_images/en/compare.97746cd0f9074955.webp)

**💡 Key Insights to Discover:**
- When to use LLM vs SLM
- Cost vs. performance trade-offs
- Specialized capabilities of different models

## 🤖 Hands-on Exercise 2: Building Custom Agents with Agent Builder

**🎯 Objective**: Create specialized AI agents tailored for specific tasks and workflows

### 🏗️ Step 1: Understanding Agent Builder

Agent Builder is where Microsoft Foundry Toolkit truly shines. It allows you to create purpose-built AI assistants that combine the power of large language models with custom instructions, specific parameters, and specialized knowledge.

**🧠 Agent Architecture Components:**
- **Core Model**: The foundation LLM (GPT-4, Groks, Phi, etc.)
- **System Prompt**: Defines agent personality and behavior
- **Parameters**: Fine-tuned settings for optimal performance
- **Tools Integration**: Connect to external APIs and MCP services
- **Memory**: Conversation context and session persistence

```

*Of course, you can also use Generate System Prompt to use AI to help you generate and optimize prompts*

**🔧 Parameter Optimization:**
| Parameter | Recommended Range | Use Case |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Temperature** | 0.1-0.3 | Technical/factual responses |
| **Temperature** | 0.7-0.9 | Creative/brainstorming tasks |
| **Max Tokens** | 500-1000 | Concise responses |
| **Max Tokens** | 2000-4000 | Detailed explanations |
