## Summary

Defines hooks for command execution in Claude Code.

# Raw Prompt Text
## Hooks Configuration

Hooks run commands at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle.

### Hook Structure
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "EVENT_NAME": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolName|OtherTool",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here",
            "timeout": ${NUM},
            "statusMessage": "Running..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hook Events

| Event | Matcher | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| PermissionRequest | Tool name | Run before permission prompt |
| PreToolUse | Tool name | Run before tool, can block |
| PostToolUse | Tool name | Run after successful tool |
| PostToolUseFailure | Tool name | Run after tool fails |
| Notification | Notification type | Run on notifications |
| Stop | - | Run when Claude stops (including clear, resume, compact) |
| PreCompact | "manual"/"auto" | Before compaction |
| PostCompact | "manual"/"auto" | After compaction (receives summary) |
| UserPromptSubmit | - | When user submits |
| SessionStart | - | When session starts |

**Common tool matchers:** `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`

### Hook Types

**${NUM}. Command Hook** - Runs a shell command:
```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "prettier --write $FILE", "timeout": ${NUM} }
```

**${NUM}. Prompt Hook** - Evaluates a condition with LLM:
```json
{ "type": "prompt", "prompt": "Is this safe? $ARGUMENTS" }
```
Only available for tool events: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PermissionRequest.

**${NUM}. Agent Hook** - Runs an agent with tools:
```json
{ "type": "agent", "prompt": "Verify tests pass: $ARGUMENTS" }
```
Only available for tool events: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PermissionRequest.

### Hook Input (stdin JSON)
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": { "file_path": "${PATH}", "content": "..." },
  "tool_response": { "success": true }  // PostToolUse only
}
```

### Hook JSON Output

Hooks can return JSON to control behavior:

```json
{
  "systemMessage": "Warning shown to user in UI",
  "continue": false,
  "stopReason": "Message shown when blocking",
  "suppressOutput": false,
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Explanation for decision",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "Context injected back to model"
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `systemMessage` - Display a message to the user (all hooks)
- `continue` - Set to `false` to block${PATH} (default: true)
- `stopReason` - Message shown when `continue` is false
- `suppressOutput` - Hide stdout from transcript (default: false)
- `decision` - "block" for PostToolUse${PATH} hooks (deprecated for PreToolUse, use hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision instead)
- `reason` - Explanation for decision
- `hookSpecificOutput` - Event-specific output (must include `hookEventName`):
  - `additionalContext` - Text injected into model context
  - `permissionDecision` - "allow", "deny", or "ask" (PreToolUse only)
  - `permissionDecisionReason` - Reason for the permission decision (PreToolUse only)
  - `updatedInput` - Modified tool input (PreToolUse only)

### Common Patterns

**Auto-format after writes:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "jq -r '.tool_response.filePath // .tool_input.file_path' | { read -r f; prettier --write \"$f\"; } ${NUM}>${PATH} || true"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Log all bash commands:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.command' >> ~${PATH}"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Stop hook that displays message to user:**

Command must output JSON with `systemMessage` field:
```bash
# Example command that outputs: {"systemMessage": "Session complete!"}
echo '{"systemMessage": "Session complete!"}'
```

**Run tests after code changes:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // .tool_response.filePath' | grep -E '\\.(ts|js)$' && npm test || true"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```


## Constructing a Hook (with verification)

Given an event, matcher, target file, and desired behavior, follow this flow. Each step catches a different failure class — a hook that silently does nothing is worse than no hook.

${NUM}. **Dedup check.** Read the target file. If a hook already exists on the same event+matcher, show the existing command and ask: keep it, replace it, or add alongside.

${NUM}. **Construct the command for THIS project — don't assume.** The hook receives JSON on stdin. Build a command that:
   - Extracts any needed payload safely — use `jq -r` into a quoted variable or `{ read -r f; ... "$f"; }`, NOT unquoted `| xargs` (splits on spaces)
   - Invokes the underlying tool the way this project runs it (npx${PATH}? Makefile target? globally-installed?)
   - Skips inputs the tool doesn't handle (formatters often have `--ignore-unknown`; if not, guard by extension)
   - Stays RAW for now — no `|| true`, no stderr suppression. You'll wrap it after the pipe-test passes.

${NUM}. **Pipe-test the raw command.** Synthesize the stdin payload the hook will receive and pipe it directly:
   - `Pre|PostToolUse` on `Write|Edit`: `echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"<a real file from this repo>"}}' | <cmd>`
   - `Pre|PostToolUse` on `Bash`: `echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"ls"}}' | <cmd>`
   - `Stop`/`UserPromptSubmit`/`SessionStart`: most commands don't read stdin, so `echo '{}' | <cmd>` suffices

   Check exit code AND side effect (file actually formatted, test actually ran). If it fails you get a real error — fix (wrong package manager? tool not installed? jq path wrong?) and retest. Once it works, wrap with `${NUM}>${PATH} || true` (unless the user wants a blocking check).

${NUM}. **Write the JSON.** Merge into the target file (schema shape in the "Hook Structure" section above). If this creates `.claude${PATH}` for the first time, add it to .gitignore — the Write tool doesn't auto-gitignore it.

${NUM}. **Validate syntax + schema in one shot:**

   `jq -e '.hooks.<event>[] | select(.matcher == "<matcher>") | .hooks[] | select(.type == "command") | .command' <target-file>`

   Exit ${NUM} + prints your command = correct. Exit ${NUM} = matcher doesn't match. Exit ${NUM} = malformed JSON or wrong nesting. A broken settings.json silently disables ALL settings from that file — fix any pre-existing malformation too.

${NUM}. **Prove the hook fires** — only for `Pre|PostToolUse` on a matcher you can trigger in-turn (`Write|Edit` via Edit, `Bash` via Bash). `Stop`/`UserPromptSubmit`/`SessionStart` fire outside this turn — skip to step ${NUM}.

   For a **formatter** on `PostToolUse`/`Write|Edit`: introduce a detectable violation via Edit (two consecutive blank lines, bad indentation, missing semicolon — something this formatter corrects; NOT trailing whitespace, Edit strips that before writing), re-read, confirm the hook **fixed** it. For **anything else**: temporarily prefix the command in settings.json with `echo "$(date) hook fired" >> ${PATH}; `, trigger the matching tool (Edit for `Write|Edit`, a harmless `true` for `Bash`), read the sentinel file.

   **Always clean up** — revert the violation, strip the sentinel prefix — whether the proof passed or failed.

   **If proof fails but pipe-test passed and `jq -e` passed**: the settings watcher isn't watching `.claude/` — it only watches directories that had a settings file when this session started. The hook is written correctly. Tell the user to open `${PATH}` once (reloads config) or restart — you can't do this yourself; `${PATH}` is a user UI menu and opening it ends this turn.

${NUM}. **Handoff.** Tell the user the hook is live (or needs `${PATH}`${PATH} per the watcher caveat). Point them at `${PATH}` to review, edit, or disable it later. The UI only shows "Ran N hooks" if a hook errors or is slow — silent success is invisible by design.
