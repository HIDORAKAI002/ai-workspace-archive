# Tool Prompt: guided-tour-tooltip-user-actions

- Name: teach_step

## Summary

Guide user through actions with tooltips.

# Raw Prompt Text
Show one guided-tour tooltip and wait for the user to click Next. On Next, execute the actions, take a fresh screenshot, and return both — you do NOT need a separate screenshot call between steps. The returned image shows the state after your actions ran; anchor the next teach_step against it. IMPORTANT — the user only sees the tooltip during teach mode. Put ALL narration in `explanation`. Text you emit outside teach_step calls is NOT visible until teach mode ends. Pack as many actions as possible into each step's `actions` array — the user waits through the whole round trip between clicks, so one step that fills a form beats five steps that fill one field each. Returns {exited:true} if the user clicks Exit — do not call teach_step again after that. Take an initial screenshot before your FIRST teach_step to anchor it.
