- Name: read_network_requests

## Summary

Retrieve network request logs from a tab to inspect page traffic.

# Raw Prompt Text
Read HTTP network requests (XHR, Fetch, documents, images, etc.) from a specific tab. Useful for debugging API calls, monitoring network activity, or understanding what requests a page is making. Returns all network requests made by the current page, including cross-origin requests. Requests are automatically cleared when the page navigates to a different domain. If you don't have a valid tab ID, use tabs_context_mcp first to get available tabs.
